wordle  guy


## how wordle works
- all black squares
- 5 letter words
- 6 tries
- right letter right place = green
- right letter wrong place = yellow
- wrong letter = gray
- one word a day (mean, not good for wives)
- guesses have to be in corpus
- fake keyboard, colored keys on bottom (prob still works with keyboard input on desktop)

## what i wanna do
- same thing as wordle
- base one word a day per number of letters
- practice mode has more words a day
- support for more guesses
- support for different amount of letters
- not green bc that's stupid. girls like pink and orange ðŸ¥°
- user authentication
- send a user a puzzle (collection of words)
